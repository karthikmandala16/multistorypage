    <p class="circ"><font size="4">Cricket grew out of the many stick-andball games played in England 500 years
        ago. The word ‘bat’ is an old English word that
        simply means stick or club. By the seventeenth
        century, cricket had evolved enough to be
        recognisable as a distinct game. Till the middle of
        the eighteenth century, bats were roughly the same
        shape as hockey sticks, curving outwards at the
        bottom. There was a simple reason for this: the ball
        was bowled underarm, along the ground and the
        curve at the end of the bat gave the batsman the
        best chance of making contact. One of the peculiarities of cricket is that a
        Test match can go on for five days and still end in a draw. No other modern team sport takes even
        half as much time to complete. A football match
        is generally over in an hour-and-a-half. Even
        baseball completes nine innings in less than half
        the time that it takes to play a limited-overs match,
        the shortened version of modern cricket! Another curious characteristic of cricket is that
        the length of the pitch is specified—22 yards—
        but the size or shape of the ground is not. Most
        other team sports such as hockey and football
        lay down the dimensions of the playing area.
        Cricket does not. Grounds can be oval like the
        Adelaide Oval or nearly circular, like Chepauk in
        Chennai. A six at the Melbourne Cricket Ground
        needs to clear much more ground than it does at
        Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi. There’s a historical reason behind both these
        oddities. Cricket was the earliest modern team
        sport to be codified. The first written ‘Laws of
        Cricket’ were drawn up in 1744. They stated,
        “the principals shall choose from amongst the
        gentlemen present two umpires who shall
        absolutely decide all disputes. The stumps must
        be 22 inches high and the bail across them six
        inches. The ball must be between five and six
        ounces, and the two sets of stumps 22 yardsapart”. The world’s first cricket club was formed
        in Hambledon in the1760s and the Marylebone
        Cricket Club (MCC) was founded in 1787.
        During the 1760s and 1770s it became common
        to pitch the ball through the air rather than roll
        it along the ground. This change gave bowlers
        the options of length, deception through the air,
        plus increased pace. It also opened new
        possibilities for spin and swing. In response,
        batsmen had to master timing and shot
        selection. One immediate result was the
        replacement of the curved bat with the straight
        one. The weight of the ball was limited to between
        5½ to 5¾ ounces, and the width of the bat to
        four inches. In 1774, the first leg-before law was
        published. Also around this time, a third stump
        became common. By 1780, three days had
        become the length of a major match, and this
        year also saw the creation of the first six-seam
        cricket ball.

        <p class="circ"><font size="4">The India men's national cricket team represent India in men's international cricket. It is governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and is a Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status.

            India's men's national cricket team played its first international match on 25 June 1932 in a Lord's Test against England becoming the sixth team to be granted Test cricket status. India had to wait until 1952, approximately twenty years to its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, success was limited, with only 35 wins in 196 Tests.[10] The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of the Indian spin quartet, and players like Sunil Gavaskar, Gundappa Viswanath, and Kapil Dev. In men's limited-overs cricket, India made its ODI debut against England in 1974 and T20I debut against South Africa in 2006.
            
            The team has won five major ICC tournaments, winning the Cricket World Cup twice (1983 and 2011[11]), the ICC T20 World Cup once (2007) and the ICC Champions Trophy twice (2002 and 2013). They have also finished as runners-up in the World Cup twice (2003 and 2023), the T20 World Cup once (2014), the Champions Trophy twice (2000 and 2017) and the ICC World Test Championship finals in the first two editions (2021, 2023). It was the second team after the West Indies to win the World Cup and the first team to win the World Cup on home soil after winning the 2011 Cricket World Cup.</font></p1>
